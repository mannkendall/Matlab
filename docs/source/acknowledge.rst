Acknowledging |name|
====================

1. Only use lower case letters when mentioning |name|. Always include the language and version
   number. Ideally, you should also include the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) associated to the
   specific release you have been using:

   |name| |github| |DOI|

2. If |name| was useful for your research, please cite the dedicated article:

   `Collaud Coen et al., 2020, ... <http:....>`__

3. |name| relies on Tami Bond (yark@colostate.edu) functions `varg_proof` and `varg_val` under their
    own license that should be acknowledged.

4. |name| relies on external Matlab libraries that also require & deserve to be acknowledged in
   their own right. The following LaTeX blurb is one way to do so:

   .. code-block:: latex

        This research has made use of \textit{mannkendall v1.0.0} \citep[DOI:][]{CollaudCoen2020}
        Matlab code. \textit{mannkendall} relies on the following Matlab tools:

    When the time comes, include here the link to the dedicated mannkendall article.
